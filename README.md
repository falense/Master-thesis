Thesis
======

This repository contains the code used in my thesis project. In my thesis I apply a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to finding good configurations of receivers for geolocating radio frequency emitters using Power Difference of Arrival (PDOA). Part of the code was ported to CUDA to gain sufficient speedup as the evaluation of inidividuals (in the GA) is quite time consuming. 

For more information about the project and the implementation, refer to the pdf found in the Report subfolder.
